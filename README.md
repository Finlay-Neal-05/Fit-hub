# Fit Hub

fit hub was a group project I worked on while at Dev Academy. It is our take on the classic workout tracker app. In this project, I was mostly responsible for the client side forms and user input.


### Installation

clone this repo and then...

```

cd Fit-Hub
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
